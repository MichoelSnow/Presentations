# The Basics
## Getting R up and Running
### Installing R
If you don't have them already installed you need to download and install R and R studio  

- [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
- [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Topics we will be covering
<!-- $$ x = \dfrac{5}{4}$$ -->

### Introduction to R

- R is an open source programming environment
- It is most commonly used for statistical computing and graphics
- The basic functionality of R can be extended with 'packages'


<!-- ### Introduction to R studio -->

<!-- - R studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)  within which you can write/edit code, run code, display plots/graphics and a whole host of other functions  -->

## Getting Started
### Getting Started


- Download and open the RBootcamp.R file from my [GitHub Folder](https://github.com/mseinstein/Presentations/tree/master/RBootcamp)  
- The rest of the information on the slides, after the next one, is all within the R file

### Running code in R

- To run any line of code use \cb{\texttt{Ctrl}}/\cb{\texttt{Cmd}} + \cb{\texttt{Enter}}
    - R will run the highlighted code OR
    - R will run the line of code which the cursor is on

### Mathematical Operators

```{r, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
-sqrt(25) + (5+3)/4*7 - 2^2
5%/%3 # Integer Division
5%%3 # Modulo (remainder after division)
```
### Boolean Operators

```{r, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
5 == 6
5 != 6
83 >= (25 < 23)
(5 > 3) & (3 > 2 | 4 > 1)
```

### Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

### Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
