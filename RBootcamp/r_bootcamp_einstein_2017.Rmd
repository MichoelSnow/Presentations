## Getting R up and Running
### Installing R

If you don't have them already installed you need to download and install R and R studio  

- Download R
    - <https://cran.r-project.org/>  
- R Studio
    - <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>


### Introduction to R

- R is an open source programming environment
- It is most commonly used for statistical computing and graphics
- The basic functionality of R can be extended with 'packages'

### Introduction to R studio

- R studio is an IDE within which you can write/edit code, run code, display plots/graphics and a whole host of other functions

### Getting Started


- Go to <https://github.com/mseinstein/> to download the Presentions > RBootCamp > r_bootcamp_einstein_2017.R file   
- All the code presented here is within that R file

### Running code in R

- To run any line of code use <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> 
    - R will run the highlighted code OR
    - R will run the line of code which the cursor is on

### Mathematical and Boolean Operators

```{r, error=TRUE}
-sqrt(25) + (5+3)/4*7 - 2^2
5%/%3 # Integer Division
5%%3 # Modulo (remainder after division)
5 == 6
5 != 6
83 > (25 >= 23)
5 > 3 & 3 < 2
5 > 3 | 3 < 2
```

### Vectors and Sequences
```{r}
1:4
c(5,3,2,1) # Creates a list
c(12,1:4,6)
seq(from = 1, t= 10, by = 2) # Creates a vector with the given paramters
seq(1,10,2) # creates the same vector without naming the paramters
seq(1,10) # R uses the default values for any empty parameters
seq(to = 10, by = 2)
seq(by = 2, to = 10)
c(seq(1,10,2), 25, 10)
c(seq(1,10,2), 25, 10) > 12
c(seq(1,10,2), 25, 10) * 2
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
