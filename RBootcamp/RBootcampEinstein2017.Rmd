# The Basics
## Getting R up and Running
### Installing R
If you don't have them already installed you need to download and install R and R studio  

- [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
- [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Topics we will be covering
$$ x = \dfrac{5}{4}$$

### Introduction to R

- R is an open source programming environment
- It is most commonly used for statistical computing and graphics
- The basic functionality of R can be extended with 'packages'


<!-- ### Introduction to R studio -->

<!-- - R studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)  within which you can write/edit code, run code, display plots/graphics and a whole host of other functions  -->

## Getting Started
### Getting Started


- Download and open the RBootcamp.R file from my [GitHub Folder](https://github.com/mseinstein/Presentations/tree/master/RBootcamp)  
- The rest of the information on the slides, after the next one, is all within the R file

### Running code in R

- To run any line of code use \cb{\texttt{Ctrl}}/\cb{\texttt{Cmd}} + \cb{\texttt{Enter}}
    - R will run the highlighted code OR
    - R will run the line of code which the cursor is on

### Basic mathematical functions

```{r, echo=TRUE}
(5+3)*7 - 2^2/3
(5+3)*7 - 2^2/3
```
